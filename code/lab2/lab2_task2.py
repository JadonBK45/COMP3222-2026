    # Then one-hot encode Outlook, keeping Temp, Humidity, and Windy numeric.

    # Check that the transformed X has shape (14, 6).

    # B. Fit a DecisionTreeClassifier to the numeric features and y.
    # Use sklearn.tree.plot_tree with feature_names and class_names.
    # If you used a Pipeline, plot its fitted tree step, not the Pipeline itself.
    # How does this tree compare with the one from the lecture?

    # Try ExtraTreeClassifier as well. Compare the two trees and their
    # training predictions. What would you need to compare them fairly on
    # new data?
